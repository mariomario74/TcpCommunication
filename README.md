# TcpCommunication
Tcp communication based on a sender and a receiver.

Momentarily just a basic one way communication between two "sockets" using TcpClient and TcpListener.

Can be scaled up to support things like maybe playing TicTacToe with someone who has access to this server and port.

In the Executable folder you can find direct .exe files of the code which run perfectly fine.

In the other two you can find the source code and project.

The link to a portable directly .exe file can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k8EoL62D4XXqTA5KLAtz3bb_mvyM98_-?usp=sharing
To run it just find TicTacToe.exe and run it. For simplicity you can send a shortcut to desktop.
